I want to believe in prophecy.

I want to believe that my life will amount to something.

Some time ago, working at Nijiya in OÊ»ahu, a lady gave me an unprompted fortune.

She basically said that I would write a book and help people.

She invited me for consultation. Maybe I look like a chump.

The Bible tells not to consult with doers of black magics -- not because they are wrong, but for the risk of attachment, perhaps?

Nevertheless, a blessing is a blessing. I did not consult with her. I accept her kind words and may she be blessed and freed of spiritual attachments.

The message at church two weeks ago was about the lady who was the uninvited mouth-trumpet for Paul and Silas as they were spreading the Word of God in her town.

She was being used by some wealthy folk, pimped up to be their fortune-telling monkey.

Paul and Silas, annoyed, cast the spirit out of her. Did they do it for mercy or for annoyance, or both?

I liked the message the pastor shared, that in her incessance was likely a cry to be free of her masters and her dark attachments.

She was a butterfly, pimped, now free. She knocked and kept knocking and the door was opened.

There is also the [parable of the persistent widow](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2018&version=NIV), which speaks of a woman who plead with the judge every day to grant her justice from her adversary. He folded with time.

Ask and keep asking. Walk humbly with God, trusting that in time, the moral arc of the world bends toward His justice.

Did you know Martin Luther King Jr. was one of the visionaries behind the Community Land Trusts we know today?

> The goal of New Communities was to provide Black farmers with access to land, allowing them to work it cooperatively and build sustainable livelihoods, particularly after being forcibly evicted from their land for their involvement in the civil rights movement.

I hope to provide opportunity to others in the future. Do I really hope so, or am I just saying?

Will I really do something to build my character?

People who talk a lot about God are often sluggards...
