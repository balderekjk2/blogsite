Aren't they cute?

TIL the wordplay between "cat list" and catalyst.

I remember freecodecamp's first lesson was a cat list, now I wonder if that was intentional.

Anyway, I am a damned overthinker. As a result, I do not frequently finish the personal projects that I start.

I figured I would create this here as an accountability measure of sorts and commit to updating it at least once a week.

I want to iterate this website, meaning that its look and feel will change over time.

And I want to document the technical journey and make the code available.
